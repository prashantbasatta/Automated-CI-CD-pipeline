# Automated-CI-CD-pipeline
Automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Docker, and AWS. In this project, I will be creating an automated CI/CD pipeline for Java project using Jenkins, Docker, and AWS. With this pipeline, the project will be automatically built, tested, and deployed to AWS EC2 instance every time you push code to your GitHub repository.
